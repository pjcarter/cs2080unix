Command Execution Process
==

from Your UNIX, the Ultimate Guide p.252


1.  parses the command into words (white space signals the end of word), puts 1 space between each.
2.	Second pass
variables are replaced with their values (if syntax is correct)
3.	Commands surrounded by `` ` `` or `$( )` are executed (this is recursive â€“ steps 1-3 might need to be repeated) and their output strings are substituted into the command.
4.	The shell checks to see if any files (`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`) are redirected, if so the redirected files are opened.
5.	Wildcards are expanded and replaced with matching filenames.
6.	The shell looks for the directory containing the executable using the `$PATH` variable.

Example
--

    $ echo `ls f*`
    fame.out fortune.txt
